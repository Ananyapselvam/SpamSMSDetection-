Spam SMS Detector

This project is a machine learning-based application for classifying SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (legitimate). It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a trained model to provide real-time predictions.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw SMS text data.
Model Training: Uses a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes) to train a classification model.
Text Vectorization: Converts text messages into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.
Real-time Prediction: Classifies new, unseen SMS messages with high accuracy.

Project Structure

app.py: The main Python script that contains the core logic for the application.
spamsmsdetection.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that details the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
spam.csv: The dataset used to train the model.
spam_model.pkl: The pickled file containing the trained machine learning model.
vectorizer.pkl: The pickled file containing the fitted text vectorizer.
requirements.txt: A list of all the Python dependencies required to run this project.
